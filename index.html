        <p>Welcome! My name is Jennifer Kuronya, and I’m proud of the journey that has shaped my career and passion for helping others. For 25 years, I served as a parole agent with the State of Pennsylvania’s Parole Board, balancing public safety with supporting individuals in their reintegration journeys. After retiring from that role, I transitioned into education and have spent the past four years as a paraprofessional in a kindergarten classroom at Executive Education Charter School in Allentown, PA.</p>
  
        <p>Both careers have allowed me to make meaningful contributions to my community, whether guiding individuals toward new opportunities or fostering young learners’ growth. I’m passionate about making a difference and excited to share my story with you!</p>
