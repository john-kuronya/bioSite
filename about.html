            <p>For 25 years, my career as a Pennsylvania state parole agent has been both challenging and rewarding. I have had the opportunity to serve my community by helping individuals transition from incarceration back into society while ensuring public safety. Each day brought a unique set of challenges, from conducting investigations and monitoring compliance to providing resources and support for rehabilitation. I took pride in building relationships based on accountability and trust, guiding parolees toward positive choices that not only impacted their lives but also strengthened the fabric of the community. My role often required a balance between enforcement and empathy, and I embraced the complexity of those dual responsibilities.<br><br>

			Reflecting on this journey, I am proud of the resilience and adaptability I’ve developed. From testifying in court hearings to conducting home visits in unpredictable environments, I have faced situations that demanded quick thinking and composure. I’ve also seen the transformative power of second chances, as many individuals were able to overcome their past mistakes and build meaningful futures. These success stories remind me why I chose this profession and reaffirm the importance of our work. Over the years, I’ve gained invaluable experiences, collaborated with dedicated colleagues, and contributed to policies that shaped the parole system in Pennsylvania. It has truly been a career defined by purpose and commitment <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/parole/parole-process/parole-interview/parole-overview.html" target="_blank">PA Parole.com</a>.

            <p>Following my retirement from PA State Parole, I now have the privilege of working as a paraprofessional in a kindergarten class at Executive Education Academy Charter School in Allentown, PA. This role allowed me to contribute to the foundational years of children's education, fostering their growth academically, socially, and emotionally. I supported the lead teacher by assisting with lesson preparation, small group activities, and one-on-one guidance to ensure each child received the attention they needed to thrive. Watching the students' faces light up as they mastered new skills or discovered their creativity was truly rewarding. Beyond academics, I cherished the opportunity to nurture a positive and supportive classroom environment where students felt safe and encouraged to express themselves. This experience taught me the importance of patience, adaptability, and the profound impact early education can have on a child’s future. <a href="https://ee-schools.org/" target="_blank">Executive Education.org</a>.
